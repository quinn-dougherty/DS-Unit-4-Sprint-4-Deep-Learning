Perhaps what we're looking for isn't intelligence, but consciousness - and specifically, consciousness *we* recognize and empathize with. Much like all parents, us humans want to foster something new in our image, and see it succeed in a way we appreciate.\n",

The structure and approach to artificial intelligence is inherently, well, artificial - some things like neural networks are \"inspired\" by biology, but still very different (far fewer connections, but far faster with more data). Perhaps computers really already *are* intelligent, just not in a way we recognize.\n",

If we can create an AGI from metal and sand, then are we not just mechanisms of a different sort?"
